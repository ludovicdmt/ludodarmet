            "content": "High frequencies and low amplitude SSVEP-based BCI . We believe that one of the major hurdle to disseminate BCI technology from laboratories to use in the wild by a a general audience is the poor user experience. For instance, Steady-States Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) refer to the sustained rhythmic activity observed in surface electroencephalography (EEG) in response to the presentation of Repetitive Visual Stimuli (RVS). Due to their robustness and rapid onset, SSVEP have been widely used in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). However, typical SSVEP stimuli are straining to the eyes and present risks of triggering epileptic seizures. Reducing visual stimuli contrast or extending their frequency range both appear as relevant solutions to address these issues. It however remains sparsely documented how BCI performance is impacted by these features and to which extent user experience can be improved. In that respect, we have focused on the improvement of the user comfort by making SSVEP stimuli less instrutive. . Reduction of stimuli depth . Our first results on SSVEP-BCI with reduction of stimuli depth can be found here. Using two popular decoding algorithms, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Task-Related Component Analysis (TRCA) we have demonstrated that a SSVEP-BCI is still operable with only 10% of amplitude depth. This large amplitude reduction provided a significant improvement in the subjective rating of comfort by our users. . High frequencies (&gt;30Hz) SSVEP-BCI . We have then investigated the use of high frequencies and a combination with amplitude reduction. This work is currently under-review and will be published soon. The results revealed that although high frequency stimuli improve visual comfort, their classification performance were not competitive enough to design a reliable/responsive BCI. Importantly, we found that the amplitude depth reduction of low frequency RVS is an effective solution to improve user experience while maintaining high classification performance. These findings were further validated by an online T9 SSVEP-BCI in which stimuli with 40% amplitude depth reduction achieved comparable results (&gt;90% accuracy) to full amplitude stimuli while significantly improving user experience. .",

After high school and two years of preparotory classes for the Grandes Ecoles, I joined Ecole Centrale de Lille, a generalist engineering school in Lille, notrth of France. I graduated in 2017 with a specialization in Data Science and AI. It lead me to join GIPSA-lab for 3 years PhD, obtained in December 2020. I was supervised by Kai Wang and François Cayre. I worked on image manipulation detection, namely image forensics, funded by an ANR-DGA project managed by Patrick Bas. Since March 2021, I am part of the neuro-ergonomics and human-factors department from ISAE-Supaero. I work in the team of Frédéric Dehais on reactive BCI using Visually Evoqued Potentials and passive BCI. .",
