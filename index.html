My name is Ludovic DARMET, postdoctoral researcher in non-invasive Brain Computer Interface (BCI) at ISAE-SUPAERO, in [Frédéric Dehais'](https://pagespro.isae-supaero.fr/frederic-dehais/) team. 

Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) try to leverage the brain electrical activity of a subject to gain active or passive control over a computer or a robotic limb.  
We are mostly focused on brain electrical activity measured through electroencephalography (EEG). Furthermore, in the big family of BCIs, we are 
particularly interested in reactive BCI using Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP and c-VEP) but also passive BCI to assess the cognitive state of the subject
and adapt the computer interactions accordingly.
