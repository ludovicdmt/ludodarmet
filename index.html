Hello, my name is Ludovic DARMET, postdoctoral researcher in non-invasive Brain Computer Interface at ISAE-SUPAERO, in [Frédéric Dehais](https://pagespro.isae-supaero.fr/frederic-dehais/) team. 

Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) try to leverage brain electrical activity of a subject to gain active or passive control over a computer or a robotic limb.  
We are mostly focused on brain electrical activity measured trough electroencephalography (EEG). Furthermore in the big familliy of BCIs, we are 
particularly interested in reactive BCI using Visually Evoqued Potentials (SSVEP and c-VEP) but also passive BCI to asses the cognitive state of the subject
and adapt the computer interactions accordingly. 

You can contact me on first firstname.lastname at isae-supaero.fr.
