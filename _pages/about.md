I was born in 1993 in Annecy, in the French Alps. After two years of preparatory classes for the Grandes Ecoles, I joined the Ecole Centrale de Lille in 2013, a generalist engineering school in Lille, in the north of France. I graduated in 2017 with a specialization in [Data Science and AI](http://pierrechainais.ec-lille.fr/Centrale/Option_DAD/Accueil.html).  
I then pursued a 3-year Ph.D. with the [GIPSA-lab](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/en/home.php), which I obtained in December 2020. I was supervised by [Kai Wang](http://www.gipsa-lab.fr/~kai.wang/cv_en.html) and [Fran√ßois Cayre](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=spuWfK8AAAAJ&hl=fr). I worked on image manipulation detection, namely image forensics, funded by an ANR-DGA project managed by [Patrick Bas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OgaFhnEAAAAJ&hl=en).  
From March 2021 to March 2023, I was part of the [Neuro-Ergonomics and Human-Factors department](https://pagespro.isae-supaero.fr/neuroergonomie-et-facteurs-humains-dcas?lang=en) at ISAE-Supaero. I worked in the team of [Fr√©d√©ric Dehais](https://pagespro.isae-supaero.fr/frederic-dehais/) on reactive BCI using Visually Evoked Potentials and passive BCI.
In January 2024, I joined the ANR project [HIFI](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-20-CE17-0023) coordinated by J√©r√©mie Mattout at [CRNL](https://www.crnl.fr/en/equipe/cophy) and James Bonaiuto at [ISC](https://www.danclab.com/). I am focused on an online implemtation of pipeline for a Motor Imagery-based BCI, using beta bursts.
