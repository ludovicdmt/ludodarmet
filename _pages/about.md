I was born in 1993 in Annecy, in the French Alps. After high school and two years of preparotory classes for the Grandes Ecoles, I joined Ecole Centrale de Lille, a generalist engineering school in Lille, notrth of France. I graduated in 2017 with a specialization in [Data Science and AI](http://pierrechainais.ec-lille.fr/Centrale/Option_DAD/Accueil.html).  
It lead me to join [GIPSA-lab](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/en/home.php) for 3 years PhD, obtained in December 2020. I was supervised by [Kai Wang](http://www.gipsa-lab.fr/~kai.wang/cv_en.html) and [François Cayre](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=spuWfK8AAAAJ&hl=fr). I worked on image manipulation detection, namely image forensics, funded by an ANR-DGA project managed by [Patrick Bas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OgaFhnEAAAAJ&hl=en).  
Since March 2021, I am part of the [neuro-ergonomics and human-factors department](https://pagespro.isae-supaero.fr/neuroergonomie-et-facteurs-humains-dcas?lang=en) from ISAE-Supaero. I work in the team of [Frédéric Dehais](https://pagespro.isae-supaero.fr/frederic-dehais/) on reactive BCI using Visually Evoqued Potentials and passive BCI.
