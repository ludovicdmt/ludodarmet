- PHELMA, Grenoble INP, 2019: Advanced computer vision (2*4h), Practical sessions, 2nd-year student of engineering school (the equivalent of first-year master)  

- Grenoble University, 2019: Introduction to Python and Algorithms (9*3h), Practical sessions + end year project, First year of bachelor  

- ENSE3, Grenoble INP, 2020: Signal Processing (4*4h), Practical sessions, Last year student of engineering school (the equivalent of second-year master)  

- Grenoble University, 2020: Introduction to Python and Algorithms (9*3h), Practical sessions + end year project, First year of bachelor  

- ISAE-Supaero, 2022: Machine Learning for EEG classification (4h), Lecture and practical session,  Last year student of engineering school (the equivalent of second-year master).

I also have supervised interns and students projects:

- Ambarish Parthasarathy (6 months, bachelor thesis in ENSIMAG, Grenoble INP), 2019: Copy-move image forgery detection.

- Marine de Fontenay (6 months, last year engineer student in ISAE-Supaero) et Lison Kardassevitch (3 months, last year bachelor student in applied mathematics in Toulouse University), 2021: Auditory attention decoding using EEG.  

- Alice D√©chelette, Guilhem Glaziou, Kinza Kasmi, and David Valdivia (last year project of engineering school, ISAE-Supaero), 2021: Students have collaborated with the Bee Ready company to develop an automatic tool for the analysis of video interviews. I was a scientific advisor for the project.
